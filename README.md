## Running

In order to run this project, run the Main.java file with Java 14.

### Running Options

When run, you are presented with three options in the console.

1: Custom Tester  
2: Disk Size Tester  
3: Read/Write Tester  

Custom Tester allows you to input information about your desired matrix, and then perform operations on it.

Disk Size Tester will run analytics on the bit size of the encoded matrix, and save its results in diskData.txt.

Read/Write Tester will run analytics on the runtime performance of the matrix, and save its results in runtimeData.txt.
